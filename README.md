# GameHub

GameHub is a dynamic web application developed as part of Mr. Mosh Hamedani's React tutorials from codewithmosh.com. This GitHub repository showcases an evolving platform designed to help users discover video games with a user-friendly interface and various functionalities.

## Features
- **Dark Mode and Light Mode:** GameHub provides a convenient toggle between dark mode and light mode, allowing users to switch between different visual themes based on their preference.

- **Game Search:** The website includes a robust search feature that enables users to easily find games by keywords.

- **Genre and Platform Filters:** GameHub allows users to filter games based on genres and platforms, providing a tailored experience and helping them discover games that match their preferences.

- **Game Sorting:** The repository offers sorting options, enabling users to organize games based on factors such as name, released date, or rating.

- **Game Details Page:** Each game card now links to a dedicated game details page, offering a comprehensive view that includes game descriptions, attributes, trailers, and screenshots.

- **React Query:** The implementation of React Query enhances data fetching and management, enabling smoother and more responsive interactions. This is particularly evident in the implementation of infinite scroll for browsing games.

- **Zustand State Management:** Zustand is leveraged for efficient state management, contributing to improved performance and maintainability.

- **React Router:** The incorporation of React Router creates a seamless navigation experience between pages, enhancing the overall user journey.

- **RAWG API Integration:** GameHub fetches video game data from the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs), ensuring access to an extensive and up-to-date collection of games.
